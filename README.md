# Daily-Planner

The purpose of this project is to use starting code and build a webpage that functions as a daily planner, that also saves data when refreshing the page.

When loading the webpage up, the user will see the current date and time. This page displays standard hours for a regular workday, 9 AM to 5 PM. Each hour slot will have a different background color, depending on the time: gray = time that has passed; blue = current hour; purple = future time.

The user is able to click on any hour of time, and begin typing what they plan to do. When they are finished typing their plans, clicking the save button will save their input. If the user were to refresh their page, all saved data should still be present.
